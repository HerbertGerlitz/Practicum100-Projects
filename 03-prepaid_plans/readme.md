# Analysis of Prepaid Plans
The telecom operator Megaline offers its clients two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. <br>
The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. There is data on 500 Megaline clients: Who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. <br>
The goal is to analyse the clients' behavior and to determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
