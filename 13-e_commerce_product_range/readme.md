# E-Commerce Product Range Analysis
This repository folder contains the project written in Jupyter Notebook and a presentation of the results. For displaying the total purchases per day and the individual purchase totals I created a dashboard that can be found with the following link: https://public.tableau.com/views/E-CommerceData_16447175646260/Dashboard1?:language=de-DE&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

**Description of the data:** <br>
The dataset contains the transaction history of an online store that sells household goods.
The file contains the following columns:

InvoiceNo — order identifier

StockCode — item identifier

Description — item name

Quantity

InvoiceDate — order date

UnitPrice — price per item

CustomerID

**Aim:** <br>
Identify promising products and products duo-bundles to boost profit and customer satisfaction. <br>
In order to do that we will identify keywords within the product descriptions and find the most common combinations of products being bought within the same orders.
