# Prioritization of Hypotheses and Analysis of an A/B Test
Together with the marketing department we've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. We will prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.
At the end of the analysis we will decide whether to continue the test or to stop the test. If we stop the test, we will have a leader group or we won't see differences between the groups.
