    "There are many ambiguous strings in the columns 'education' and 'purpose', so I counted the number of entries for each string. I saw that I could summarize the purposes by hand. With the word_tokenize() method I created a list for each string in the column 'purpose'. Using the lemmatize() method to nouns I could avoid mistakes like separating 'cars' and 'car'. By creating many if-cases I could summarize the purposes. I also observed that in the column 'education' the only differences of ambiguous strings were uppercase and lowercase letters. I've applied the str.lower() method to be sure every letter is lowercase. <br> \n",
    "After having reduced the number of strings in these two columns, I could find many more duplicates. A possible reason for these duplicates is that some costumers had numerous discussions about the loans in the bank and those customers had to write their reasons for the loan into the data processing system multiple times; the customers or the bank employees didn't pay attention to uppercase and lowercase letters and to the exactness of the purpose while writing down the reasons."

Interestingly, the income of the middle third has a small range from 19055 to 27577. <br> In view of the fact, that the third biggest income is roughly 100,000 units smaller than the biggest income, we can assume huge outliers in the distribution of the total incomes."

As the amount of costumers having 5 children is very small, this deviation is normal (if we only add one costumer having 5 children to the group with debts, the quote would straightly increase to 10%). The outlier at -1 children must be mistrusted since a bank won't count less than 0 children for a customer. As I already had problems with the minus sign in the column 'days_employed', it's possible that there's once again a problem with the system processing the data put in by the costumer or the bank employee. The more children we assume for a customer the smaller the number of customers having the assumed number of children; we only have 9 customers with 5 children and 0 customers with 6, 7, 8, ... children. Due to this observation I neglect the row with 20 children and 76 customers."
