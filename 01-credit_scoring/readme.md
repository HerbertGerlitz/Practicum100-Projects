# Analysis of Borrowers’ Risk of Defaulting
The task is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. We need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building a credit scoring of a potential customer. A credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
